The affected product has the Ottavi dairy label on top and is wrapped in clear plastic. It was imported to the US and sold to a distributor in Portland, Oregon. Customers who purchased the affected cheese have been contacted by the distributor. Consumers who have purchased the product are advised not to consume it and to return it to the place of purchase for a refund or discard it.
